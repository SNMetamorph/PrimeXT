# Introduction

### About project
A modern SDK for the Xash3D FWGS engine, to work on modern platforms with cross-platform support and improved graphics/physics, while retaining all the features and approaches to work inherent in GoldSrc and Xash3D.
Based on XashXT, and therefore has all the functionality inherent in XashXT and Spirit Of Half-Life. Suitable for creating both singleplayer and multiplayer mods. 

### Current functionality
- Compatibility with most of GoldSrc mods
- Absence of many limits inherent in GoldSrc and vanilla Xash3D
- Studiomodel rendering optimizations
- Inverse kinematics and jiggle bones for models
- Studiomodels weighting support
- Extended maximum map size limit (65535x65535x65535 units)
- Automatic exposure correction (eye adaptation effect)
- Support for decals on studiomodels
- Extended model limits (no more need to split into a bunch of `.smd` files)
- Dynamic lighting with shadows
- Rigid body physics (using PhysX engine)
- Normal mapping support
- Parallax mapping support
- Cubemap reflections
- HDR-rendering
- 3D skybox
- Bloom
- Sun beams shader (sunshafts/godrays)
- Feature to make the map as background in the main menu
- Mirrors
- Monitors
- Portals, with the ability to move entities through them
- Own set of utilities for development (compilers of maps, models, model viewer) 

### Future plans
- Support for physically based rendering (PBR)
- Real-time screen space reflections
- Major rendering optimizations
- Updating PhysX SDK to modern version
- Implement particle engine
- Implement ragdoll physics
- Implement vehicles
- Improvement of NPC's AI
- Adding support for OpenAL Soft / Steam Audio
- Porting to Android

### Developers and contributors
- **SNMetamorph** - Lead developer
- **Velaron** - Help with porting to Linux
- **СASPERX69X** - Testing, documentation, logo
